<p class="abcd">Aubrey Drake Graham[8] (born October 24, 1986) is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, producer, and entrepreneur.[9] Drake gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.[10]

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010,[11] which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same,[12][13] were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and a collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S.[14]

His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records.[15] The dancehall-influenced album[16][17] sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks,[18] becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, "One Dance", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.[19] Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release.[20][21] Its lead single "Hotline Bling" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song.[22]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)">see more</a></p>

His mother is a painter.[1][2] His paternal grandfather emigrated from Portugal and his paternal grandmother was Afro-Jamaican; his mother is of English and Chinese-Jamaican descent, and his father is of Sephardic Portuguese Jewish descent.[3][4] Sean Paul was raised as a Catholic.[5] Many members of his family are swimmers. His grandfather was on the first Jamaican men's national water polo team.[citation needed] His father also played water polo for the team in the 1960s, and competed in long-distance swimming, while Paul's mother was a butterfly swimmer.[3] Paul played for the national water polo team from the age of 13 to 21, when he gave up the sport in order to launch his musical career.[citation needed] He attended Wolmer's Boys' School and the College of Arts, Science, and Technology, now known as the University of Technology, where he was trained in commerce with an aim of pursuing an occupation in swimming.[citation needed]

In 2012, Paul married his longtime girlfriend Jodi Stewart, a Jamaican TV host.[6][7] In August 2016, it was announced that the couple was expecting their first child.[8] On 26 February 2017, Sean Paul announced the birth of his son, Levi Blaze.[9]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Paul">see more</a></p></div>

<h1 class="abcd1">Personal Life &amp; Career Achievements</h1>
<p class="abcd">Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; often stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive, film producer, and actor. He is consistently cited as one of the greatest and most influential artists of all time in hip hop, with Rolling Stone placing him in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and labeling him the "King of Hip Hop".[3]

After his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP, which earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.[4] His next two releases, 2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The Eminem Show, were worldwide successes, with each being certified diamond in U.S. sales and both winning Best Rap Album Grammy Awards—making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs. They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005 partly due to a prescription drug addiction.[5] He released Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010. Both won Grammy Awards and Recovery was the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, the second time he had the international best-selling album of the year (after The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album, 2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2, won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15.[4][6] These were followed by 2017's Revival and 2018's Kamikaze,[7] the latter being the best-selling hip hop album of 2018.[3]

In addition to his solo career, Eminem is an original member of the Midwest hip hop groups Soul Intent and D12. He is also known for his collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil. Eminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records, with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent. Eminem has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, he starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile playing himself, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for "Lose Yourself", becoming the first rap artist to ever win the award.[8] Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), and The Interview (2014), and the television series Entourage (2010)..<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem">see more</a></p></div>

<p class="abcd">Khaled Mohamed Khaled (born November 26, 1975),[1] better known by his stage name DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, songwriter, record producer, media personality, and record executive.[2][3]

Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Khaled first gained prominence as a radio host in the 1990s, whereby after moving to Miami, he hosted the show "99 Jamz" on urban music radio station WEDR; the show's popularity later prompted hip hop group Terror Squad to hire Khaled as the DJ for their live performances. After gaining some production credits on the group's material,[4] Khaled then transitioned into curating albums, releasing his debut studio album Listennn... the Album in 2006, which earned gold certification.

He followed that up with the album We the Best (2007), which contained the top 20 single "I'm So Hood". His subsequent two releases — We Global (2008) and Victory (2010) — were released after the founding of Khaled's record label We the Best Music Group. Both albums charted within the top ten on the US Billboard 200, with the latter containing the single "All I Do Is Win", which was eventually certified triple platinum.

His fifth studio album We the Best Forever (2011) also saw similar commercial success, and helped bring Khaled to international prominence, as it featured the song "I'm on One", which became his first top ten hit. His sixth and seventh album, Kiss the Ring (2012) and Suffering from Success (2013), charted in the top ten on the Billboard 200, and his eighth studio album, I Changed a Lot (2015), peaked at number 12.[5]

In 2015 and early 2016, Khaled gained worldwide attention as a media personality, and subsequently attained a large following on social media. This foresaw the release of his ninth studio album Major Key in 2016. The album attained wholesale critical and commercial success; it debuted atop the Billboard 200, it was certified gold, and received a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. He released his tenth studio album, Grateful, in 2017, which contained the singles "I'm the One" and "Wild Thoughts", which charted at number one and number two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and was also certified platinum. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd, is due to be released in 2019...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Khaled">see more</a></p></div>

<p class="abcd">Cameron Jibril Thomaz (born September 8, 1987), known professionally as Wiz Khalifa, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and actor. He released his debut album, Show and Prove, in 2006, and signed to Warner Bros. Records in 2007. His Eurodance-influenced single, "Say Yeah", received urban radio airplay, charting on the Rhythmic Top 40 and Hot Rap Tracks charts in 2008.[2]

Khalifa parted with Warner Bros. and released his second album, Deal or No Deal, in November 2009. He released the mixtape Kush and Orange Juice as a free download in April 2010; he then signed with Atlantic Records.[3] He is also well known for his debut single for Atlantic, "Black and Yellow", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut album for the label, Rolling Papers, was released on March 29, 2011.[4] He followed that album with O.N.I.F.C. on December 4, 2012, which was backed by the singles "Work Hard, Play Hard" and "Remember You". Wiz released his fifth album Blacc Hollywood on August 18, 2014, backed by the lead single "We Dem Boyz". In March 2015, he released "See You Again" for the soundtrack of the film Furious 7 and the song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks.[5]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiz_Khalifa">see more</a></p></div>
